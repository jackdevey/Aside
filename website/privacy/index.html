            <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>2nd Jul 2025 / v1.2.0+ / Revision 2</p>
            <p>
                This policy documents our guidelines for storing data entered into the Aside app on any of its supported devices. We don't sell or disclose your data to any 3rd parties not excplicitly mentioned in the document.
            </p>
            <h3>What we collect</h3>
            <p>
                Aside was designed from the ground up with privacy in mind. We don't collect any personal information about you, just the app data that you provide (the bare minimum for Aside to be functional). We have no plans to ever change this, you can be confident anything entered in the app is secure and can't be linked to you in any way.
            </p>
            <h3>Where & how we store it</h3>
            <p>
                Aside uses Apple CloudKit to sync data between your Apple devices (iPhone, iPad and Mac). Your data is stored in a private database, and encrypted with an account-based key. Therefore, we do not have access to any data stored in your iCloud account. We also do not have access to your Apple ID - only a unique identifier that is scoped to just our app. It is not possible to track your identity between apps with this identifier.

            </p>
            <h3>How to export you data</h3>
            <p>
                You can export your data easily inside of Aside on iPhone, iPad & Mac devices. Just go to Settings > App Data > Export app data as JSON. Data will be returned as a collection of JSON files for each data type in the app.
            </p>
            <h3>How to delete your data</h3>
            <p>
                You can delete your data easily inside of the System Settings on iPhone, iPad & Mac devices. Just go to Settings > iCloud > Storage > Aside > Delete Data from iCloud. Data will instantly be deleted from the device, and after a few seconds your iCloud account. Data removal is permanent and cannot be recovered afterwards. Data will be removed from all of your devices where Aside is installed.
            </p>
            <h3>About 3rd party links</h3>
            <p>
                Aside may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. These external sites are not operated by us, therefore, we strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.
            </p>
            <h3>Any questions?</h3>
            <p>
                If you have any questions about this policy or how data is stored, do not hesitate to contact <a href="mailto:jack@jw3.uk">jack@jw3.uk</a>
